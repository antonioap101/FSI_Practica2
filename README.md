# FSI Practice 2: Neural Network Image Classification 

## üìã Overview
This project involves the development of a neural network to classify a collection of images. Students have the flexibility to create their own dataset by capturing photos of different objects under varying locations and conditions. Example categories include books, kitchen utensils, coins, clothing items, toilet rolls, etc. The recommended number of distinct classes ranges from 4 to 7, with each class containing at least 20 images for training and 5 for validation.

## üéØ Objective
The main goal is to train a neural network and graphically visualize the accuracy progress for both training and validation datasets. This process utilizes the `history` object returned by the `fit` method of the model. Additionally, the project explores:

- Data augmentation on the training set.
- Testing various hyperparameter configurations to determine the optimal setup.
- Understanding the workings and rationale behind the categorical cross-entropy loss function.

## üìä Datasets
The practice was conducted with two distinct datasets: one consisting of Butterfly and Moth species, and another comprising Euro coins. Below are the categories for each dataset:

### ü¶ã Butterfly and Moth Categories:
- AN 88
- ATALA
- BANDED ORANGE HELICONIAN
- BROOKES BIRDWING
- CABBAGE WHITE
- MOURNING CLOAK
- SLEEPY ORANGE
- ZEBRA LONG WING

### üí∞ Euro Coin Categories:
- 1 cent
- 2 cents
- 5 cents
- 10 cents
- 20 cents
- 50 cents
- 1 euro
- 2 euros

The datasets used in this project were obtained from external sources and underwent certain modifications to adapt them to the project's requirements. Below, we describe the origin and modifications made to each of them:

- **Butterfly and Moth Categories:** This dataset was obtained from Kaggle through the following link: [Butterfly Images (40 Species)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/butterfly-images40-species). Although the original dataset contained images of 100 different species of butterflies and moths, specifically 8 of these species were selected for classification in this project. This selection was made to reduce the complexity of the model and focus on a more manageable set of categories.

- **Euro Coin Categories:** The dataset was obtained from Roboflow through the following link: [Coin Detection Dataset](https://universe.roboflow.com/coindetection/coin-detection-fo8ol/dataset/11). Modifications were made to this dataset, including the addition of custom images and the removal of some images that were not suitable for the neural network. Additionally, a data cleaning and improvement process was carried out to ensure the quality of the images used in training.

These datasets were selected and adapted to meet the project's requirements and to ensure data quality and suitability for image classification.

## üíª Implementation
Throughout the project, various techniques and strategies in neural network construction and optimization are employed. The use of Keras and TensorFlow frameworks facilitates the model-building process. Early stopping is one such strategy to prevent overfitting and to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.

## üöÄ Getting Started
To begin working with this project, ensure you have the required Python libraries installed, including TensorFlow, Keras, and relevant data processing libraries. Refer to the provided Jupyter notebooks for detailed implementation and further instructions on training the models with the datasets.

## üèÅ Conclusion
The project offers hands-on experience with neural networks and image classification. It provides a practical understanding of the model training process, the significance of hyperparameter tuning, and the application of data augmentation to improve model generalization.
