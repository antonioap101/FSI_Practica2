# FSI Practice 2: Neural Network Image Classification 

## üìã Overview
This project involves the development of a neural network to classify a collection of images. Students have the flexibility to create their own dataset by capturing photos of different objects under varying locations and conditions. Example categories include books, kitchen utensils, coins, clothing items, toilet rolls, etc. The recommended number of distinct classes ranges from 4 to 7, with each class containing at least 20 images for training and 5 for validation.

## üéØ Objective
The main goal is to train a neural network and graphically visualize the accuracy progress for both training and validation datasets. This process utilizes the `history` object returned by the `fit` method of the model. Additionally, the project explores:

- Data augmentation on the training set.
- Testing various hyperparameter configurations to determine the optimal setup.
- Understanding the workings and rationale behind the categorical cross-entropy loss function.

The datasets used in this project were obtained from external sources and underwent certain modifications to adapt them to the project's requirements. Below, we describe the origin and modifications made to each of them:

- **Butterfly and Moth Categories:** This dataset was obtained from Kaggle through the following link: [Butterfly Images (40 Species)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/butterfly-images40-species). Although the original dataset contained images of 100 different species of butterflies and moths, specifically 8 of these species were selected for classification in this project. This selection was made to reduce the complexity of the model and focus on a more manageable set of categories.

- **Euro Coin Categories:** The dataset was obtained from Roboflow through the following link: [Coin Detection Dataset](https://universe.roboflow.com/coindetection/coin-detection-fo8ol/dataset/11). Modifications were made to this dataset, including the addition of custom images and the removal of some images that were not suitable for the neural network. Additionally, a data cleaning and improvement process was carried out to ensure the quality of the images used in training.

These datasets were selected and adapted to meet the project's requirements and to ensure data quality and suitability for image classification.

The confusion matrix for the EuroCoinClassifier indicates high predictive accuracy, particularly with 1 euro, 2 euro and 5 cents coins, demonstrating the model's robustness. 

However, some confusion is observed between coins of similar sizes, such as 20 cents being occasionally misclassified as 50 cents and 10 cents. The 10 cents denomination also shows notable confusion with the 50 cent and 20 cent coins. 

These insights point to a need for further fine-tuning, possibly by improving feature extraction and dataset image resolution to better distinguish between coins with subtle differences.

Overall, the model's performance is promising, showcasing its potential for accurate real-world application in coin recognition tasks.
